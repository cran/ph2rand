Description: Provides functions to assist with the design of randomized
    comparative phase II oncology trials that assume their primary outcome
    variable is Bernoulli distributed. Specifically, support is provided to (a)
    perform a sample size calculation when using one of several published
    designs, (b) evaluate the operating characteristics of a given design (both
    analytically and via simulation), and (c) produce informative plots.
